# Virtual Piano Player

## "Unleash the musician within: Play the Virtual piano anytime, anywhere with our app"

My **virtual piano** application would allow users to play piano 
on their devices, the application will allow users to record their performance and
share with others, my aim will be to provide users with convenient and
user-friendly environment to learn piano at their own pace.

A piano costs a lot and not everyone can afford it, even if they can afford it finding time from their busy schedule would be difficult 
In that scenario my application will come in handy, also the feature to share your recording will allow users to showcase their progress and get feedback.

The application interests me because of my passion for music.

A *bulleted* list:
- As a user, I want to play piano anywhere and anytime.
- As a user, I want to record my music.
- As a user, I want to see effects while playing piano.
- As a user, I want to learn to play different beats with a help of a game.
